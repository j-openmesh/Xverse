pocket universe instantiations of all openmesh network's infrastructure and projects for testing,
experimentation, and/or research and development.

### Production Ready? No. Dependable? No. - Not yet; We're working on it :)

Temper your expectations - this project is alpha quality and is under active contstruction.
We all try very hard to prevent it but it may, for some unexpected and unpredictable reason,
destroy your entire machine on a whim. Here be dragons. Take caution. Caveat emptor. Provided
without any warranty or guarantee. Etc, etc. Basically: unless you understand what you see when
you look at random files in this project, you'll probably want to avoid it - for now.
